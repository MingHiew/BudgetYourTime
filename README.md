# BudgetYourTime - Empowering your time management
“Budget your time” introduces a new approach on time management, based on the realization that concepts applicable to money, such as investment and spending, can be applied on time in very much the same sense, and so is the concept “budget”. For the good of controlling our financial resource, we set budgets on our foods, housing, commuting, and we can adopt the same strategy to controlling our time resource. Using “Budget your time”, a student may create a monthly time budget of two hundred hours for his study, while a busy manager may want more time with family, and decides to allocate at least ten hours a week for his most beloved ones. What differs “Budget your time” from other to-do-lists and time management applications is that it gives users more freedom over managing their own time. “Budget your time” users are neither tied to a packed schedule of activites nor a long list of to-dos. They are free to create one, or as many budgetted categories as they want according to their priorities and interests. “Budget your time” aims at helping its users achieve their goals by committing their time an efforts over a long term process.
